## Problem statement
The tasks involved are
1.	Create a Database named “Students Record”. We are to create the following tables:
   
•	Students Info (Student ID, Gender, Name, Age, Subject)

•	Health records (Student ID, Blood Group, Height, Weight)

•	Performance (Student ID, Score, Grade)

The following information was also provided:

•	The ID has to be unique

•	Where a student has no score, it should be ‘0’ by default

•	Add a constraint that prevents the ID and Subject from taking null values

•	Apply the following modifications to the table: Change the column name ‘’Subject” to ‘’Course”, Drop the “Age” column from the ‘Students Info’ table 

2.	Retrieving data from the database:
	
•	Select the employee table and show the data where the city is Mumbai and Delhi.

•	Select the employee table where the employee’s first name has both ‘a’ and ‘e’ in them. 

•	Subset the employee table to have employees with date of birth above 1990

•	Subset the salary table to show salaries less than 1 million and sort in an ascending order

•	Modify email column of the employee table to contain just email without ‘@gmail.com’

3.	Aggregate function
   
•	What is the total number of employees in our employee table?

•	Find out the top 5 cities with the highest number of employees, then filter the result to show cities with more than 15 employees.

•	Find out the most used pin code by the employee
